Ruby Script to scrape Quarterly Balance Sheet, Income Statement and Cashflow from yahoo finance pages.

Work in progress.

This grabs the table from yahoo and packs it into value name hash.  The intent is to get this directly into an R module or Octave to calculate value and fun graphing.


TODO: 
 - Finish packing into hashes.  
 - make a class and add init, printing and formatting classes.  
 - Grab daily trading data too.  
 - add annual data
